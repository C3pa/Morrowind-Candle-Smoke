Description
____________

Adds a smoke effect to candles. It works by spawning VFX objects to create the smoke, so doesn't need to modify game content with an ESP or add objects to your save file. You can change the smoke density in the mod's MCM.

This mod is an MWSE port of wonderful OpenMW Dynamic Candle Smoke (https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/55572).

Thanks to taitechnic for OpenMW Dynamic Candle Smoke. Without this mod, I wouldn't have created this.
Thanks to the OAAB Data team for OAAB Data. The smoke effect comes from OpenMW Dynamic Candle Smoke mod which used the assets from OAAB_Data.
Thanks to Brucoms for developing the TES3 Readme Generator from which this readme was made.
